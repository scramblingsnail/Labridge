# Instrument information

## _“An extraordinary researcher make good use of instruments”_

Experimental instruments are the tools researchers use to explore and discover. 
Researchers should be thoroughly familiar with the information about each instrument to overcome difficulties 
in the experimental process and obtain credible results.

Labridge integrates the usage regulations, manuals, and precautions for all scientific instruments and equipment in the lab. 
It helps lab members understand how to use the experimental instruments, assists in instrument management, 
and simplifies training for experimental operations.

## **Instrument information database**
Labridge consolidates all relevant information about the lab's instruments into an [instrument information database](store.md), 
aiming to reduce the learning and operating costs for members related to instruments.

## **Instrument information retrieval**
Labridge performs [retrieval](retrieve.md) within the instrument information database to answer lab members' questions about 
instruments and provides the corresponding Super Users for each instrument.

## **Instrument management**
Labridge manages members' experiment logs by utilizing tools, refer to `Agent & Available tools` for details.

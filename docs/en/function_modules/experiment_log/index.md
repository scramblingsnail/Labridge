# Experimental logs

## _“Every result of your experiment has the potential to change the world.”_

Researchers explore the boundaries of human knowledge through experiments. 
Although most explorations are 'failures,' changes in the researchers' understanding might 
uncover new value from these 'failed' results. 
Alternatively, researchers in other fields might discover its unique value from a different perspective.

Therefore, every experimental result is worth detailed documentation. 
Labridge provides lab members with the functionality to record experiment logs:

### Personal experimental logs
Labridge independently records each member's [personal experiment logs](./personal_experiment/index.md) 
and assists members in organizing and integrating their experimental results.

### Shared experimental logs
Labridge also records [shared experiment results](./shared_experiment/index.md) for the entire lab. 
Members can add their own experimental results to the shared records, which are available 
for all members to search and review.

# Agent提示词框架

我们采用了 CoT(Chain of Thought) + ReAct(Reasoning & Acting) 提示词框架，
并且Labridge在 Reasoning phase 和 Acting phase 中，为提供用户进行介入的接口，使得用户可以参与
到Agent的思考与决策的过程中去，对Agent的行为提供细粒度的控制。 我们称之为 `InstructReAct`


示例：介入Agent的Reasoning & Acting

the tools in any sequence you deem appropriate to complete the task at hand.

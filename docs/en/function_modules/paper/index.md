# Paper management

## _“To catalyze the birth of new knowledge in the flow of existing knowledge.”_


An excellent researcher should track the latest research results in their field while maintaining curiosity and openness to new areas, 
as many great scientific achievements often come from the collision of ideas between different fields. 
Therefore, literature management is one of the crucial parts of a scientific laboratory. 
We hope that Labridge can help researchers manage these valuable knowledge assets and build a shared literature knowledge base 
for the laboratory, providing a platform for scientific communication and collaboration among lab members.

Labridge promotes the flow of literature knowledge and the integration of knowledge across fields in the following ways:

## **Lab's shared paper database**
Labridge collects the literature of all lab members to form a [Shared paper database](./shared_papers/index.md). 
Labridge answers relevant questions from lab members based on the content of the shared knowledge base 
and provides the source of the reference content (e.g., this paper is from member XXX). 
This allows the flow of knowledge to be unrestricted by time and space.

## **Personal recent papers**
Labridge provides each lab member with a personal [Recent paper database](./temporary_papers/index.md) to record the paper 
that the member has recently downloaded from journal websites or uploaded to Labridge. 
Labridge assists each member in better understanding the research content they are recently interested in 
based on the Recent paper database. 
It also supports members in managing their personal literature library through natural language.

## **Search and download papers**
Labridge provides a natural language interactive literature search and download tool, 
allowing researchers to stay updated with the latest research developments in their field.

Labridge currently supports searching and downloading from the following journal websites:

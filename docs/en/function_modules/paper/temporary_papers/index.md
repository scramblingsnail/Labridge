# Personal recent paper database

Labridge provides each member of the laboratory with an independent recent paper database. 
This database stores papers downloaded with the assistance of Labridge, as well as papers uploaded by the members. 
The recent paper database is regularly cleaned. If permanent storage is needed, members can request Labridge to 
store valuable papers in the laboratoryâ€™s shared paper database.
